Then the bees act, either advancing on the queen or stinging ants in their way.  The game ends either when a bee reaches the ant queen (you lose), or the entire bee flotilla has been vanquished (you win).'

The queen ant, colony, and attacking bees appear in the battlefield view at the bottom of the screen; if the battlefield is bigger than your screen, you can drag the view around.  Above the battlefield is a status bar that shows the tool you currently have selected, the number of turns elapsed since the start of the game, and the amount of food your colony has to spend on new ants.  At the very top is a toolbar where you can select different kinds of ants to place or else the tool to sacrifice ants.  The toolbar will also scroll if it does not fit on your screen.'

The only restrictions on ant placement are: 1) you cannot deploy an ant to a space that another insect is occupying or entering and 2) you cannot deploy an ant if you do not have enough food to pay for it.  The status bar will show how much an ant type costs when you have it selected.'
